# My Fresh Site

Whatever I can think of, using Deno, Fresh, Deno Deploy, and probably Supabase.

I've heard things about neon, might check that out.

Your new Fresh project is ready to go. You can follow the Fresh "Getting
Started" guide here: <https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started/>

## Usage

Make sure to install Deno: <https://deno.land/manual/getting_started/installation/>

Then start the project:

```sh
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
